# Homepage: A React app
Homepage is a simple React webapp built by me using `create-react-app` (for the boilerplate) and `react-router` (for the subsite routing)  

Purpose
-------
This is a way for me to learn React (and web development in general), and it creates a decent-looking homepage as a side effect. Some of my projects or their parts (e.g. documentation) might be hosted here in the future.
